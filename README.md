I developed a Spotify clone web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project involved creating a user-friendly music streaming platform with features such as user authentication, playlist management, a music player, search functionality, and personalized recommendations. The app showcases my proficiency in front-end web development and my ability to replicate a popular digital service, providing a seamless and engaging music streaming experience for users.
